# Me
My background trying to be a programmer.


-
Since I was young I wanted to program and make games.
I worked on making games in RPG maker and in high school
I went to a different school half day to learn how to properly program.
I never thought I was good at it but I kept on going because its 
something I was really had a passion in.

I went to college where I met some of the best people that Im glad to call my friends today, but the school was not super helpful. Teachers there didn’t want to take the time to talk to me and help me out if I was confused. Asking students basic questions in the computer lab never gave me a direct answer and asking for any 1 on 1 help with a tutor was met with a “we don’t have CS helpers on our staff”.After 2 years of struggling in CS and classes in general I decided to look for another collage, leaving my friends behind. Luckily that college was 20 minutes away, unluckily, they wouldn't accept me because, even though my high school, SAT and ACT scores were really high, my GPA at collage was so low that they wanted me to raise it before they would accept me. So I had to wait a year at a local collage getting A’s and B’s before they would accept me. Transferring schools they only took 2 years worth of credits so going on a perfect pace it would take me 2 more years to graduate. Very very often, I thought I'd never be able to graduate. That I wasn't good enough and was just wasting a very import part of my life. In all that time I worked on side projects and games. I even used rpg maker from high school to make a Pokemon game that I spent 2 years on and off again to finish… that none of my friends ever play tested or played… (shrug?). Also, going to a collage that took out its CS major when you entered your second semester and neglected to tell you doesn't really help with your education… After a lot of work and doubt I finally was able to graduate.
Fun fact, entry level jobs in programming and game design requires years of experience. I tried every CS job I could find but no matter how close I was, or how good a place I found I was never hired. In the mean time I started working with some close friends from my first collage to work on a fighting game (#maskedintent #shameplug). Which is still a great learning experience. At around 8 month I was offered a job as general IT technician doing some javascript and database management. It’s going ok but after all this time i’m still working on my dream goal to work on games for a living. I know its tough but i’ll just keep on working till I reach my dream.
